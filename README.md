# Shimmie Stack

Welcome to the Shimmie Stack. The server side stack made by Shimmie(tm).

A simple in-memory express-based CQRS eventsourced framework. It allows you as the
developer to focus on events and datamodels and iterate on them very quickly (without
being bogged down by heavy infrastructure) which you can evolve to scale as your understanding
of your domain and your needs evolve.

_The Shimmie Stack will get you there._

# Notes

-   The package is not yet published on NPM so in the meantime make sure when you pull it down you rebuild it (npm install;npx tsc)
