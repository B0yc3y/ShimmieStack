# Shimmie Stack

Welcome to the Shimmie Stack. The server side stack made by Shimmie(tm).

A simple in-memory express-based eventsourced framework. It allows you as the
developer to focus on events and datamodels and iterate on them very quickly (without
being bogged down by heavy infrastructure) which you can evolve to scale as your understanding
of your domain and your needs evolve.
