# The Shimmie Stack

A simple in-memory express-based CQRS eventsourced framework. It allows you as the 
developer to focus on events and datamodels and iterate on them very quickly (without
being bogged down by heavy infrastructure) which you can evolve to scale as your understanding
of your domain and your needs evolve.

Shimmie Stack will get you there.
